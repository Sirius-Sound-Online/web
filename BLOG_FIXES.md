### Issue 2: Formbricks Survey Shows "Loading survey..." ‚è≥ ‚Üí ‚úÖ

**Problem**: Survey component displayed "Loading survey..." indefinitely

**Root Cause**: The `surveyId="clwxyz123"` is a **placeholder**, not a real survey ID

**Solution**: Added clear explanation in the blog post:
```markdown
### User Feedback Survey

Below is a Formbricks survey component. To see it working:
1. Create a survey in your Formbricks account
2. Get the survey ID
3. Replace `surveyId="clwxyz123"` with your actual survey ID

**Note**: The survey shows "Loading survey..." because the `surveyId` is a
placeholder. In production, you would use a real survey ID from your
Formbricks dashboard.
```

**How to create a real survey**:
1. Go to https://app.formbricks.com (or your Formbricks instance)
2. Create a new survey
3. Get the survey ID from the embed code
4. Replace `clwxyz123` with your actual survey ID

### Issue 3: GitHub Login Required for Comments üîê ‚Üí ‚úÖ (By Design)

**Problem**: User logged in with **Google** on the site, but comments require **GitHub** login

**Root Cause**: This is **by design**! Here's why:

**Your site has TWO separate authentication systems:**

1. **Site Authentication (NextAuth)**:
   - Providers: Google, GitHub, Email
   - Used for: Account management, waitlist, user profile
   - Session stored in: SQLite database via Prisma
   - Your current login: Google ‚úÖ

2. **Giscus Comments (GitHub Discussions)**:
   - Provider: **GitHub only**
   - Used for: Blog post comments
   - Session stored in: GitHub (via OAuth)
   - Comments location: GitHub repository Discussions tab
   - Your login required: GitHub ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Why separate?**
- Giscus is powered by **GitHub Discussions** - a GitHub feature
- Comments are stored in your GitHub repository, not your database
- Benefits:
  - Comments are version-controlled
  - Public and transparent
  - No database storage needed
  - Leverages GitHub's spam protection
  - Developers can comment with their GitHub identity

**Solution**: Added clear explanation in blog post:
```markdown
**Note about commenting**: Comments use **Giscus**, which is powered by
GitHub Discussions. This means:
- You need a GitHub account to comment (separate from site login)
- Comments are stored in the GitHub repository's Discussions
- This keeps all discussions public and version-controlled
- Even if you're logged into the site with Google/email, you'll need to
  authenticate with GitHub to comment
```

2. **Media Examples**: Clear documentation showing how to add images, videos, audio
3. **YouTube Videos**: Working embed example (Rick Astley video)
4. **Survey Component**: Shows with proper explanation that it's a placeholder
5. **Comments Section**: Loads with clear explanation about GitHub requirement
6. **Styling**: All MDX elements properly styled (h2, h3, lists, audio, etc.)

2. **Video files**:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p public/video
   # Add your .mp4 files here
   ```
   Then use: `<BlogVideo src="/video/your-file.mp4" />`

### To Add Real Formbricks Survey:
