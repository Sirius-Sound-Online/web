We built Sirius/Serious Sound pickups to solve a persistent problem: **noise floors that spike when you lean into expressive playing**. Conventional single coils force us to choose between bandwidth and hum rejection; stacked coils dampen the shimmer we love.

Our prototype uses a hybrid core with graphene shielding and actively tuned eddy current paths. Here are the three breakthroughs:

1. **Phase-stable flux control**: we modelled the pickup as a coupled RF circuit and tuned the resonance via modular bobbins.
2. **Adaptive load shaping**: onboard micro load lets you sweep Q factors without recabling.
3. **Ultra-low-noise windings**: rewinding with silver-plated copper and cryo-treatment improved conductivity by 6%.

## Measurement stack

We run swept sine, THD, and noise profiling via our in-house rig. The chart below shows the THD delta compared to a control single coil.
