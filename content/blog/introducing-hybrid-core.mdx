We built Sirius Sound Guitar Pickups to solve a persistent problem: **noise floors that spike when you lean into expressive playing**. Conventional single coils force us to choose between bandwidth and hum rejection; stacked coils dampen the shimmer we love.

Our prototype uses a hybrid core with graphene shielding and actively tuned eddy current paths. Here are the three breakthroughs:

1. **Phase-stable flux control**: we modelled the pickup as a coupled RF circuit and tuned the resonance via modular bobbins.
2. **Adaptive load shaping**: onboard micro load lets you sweep Q factors without recabling.
3. **Ultra-low-noise windings**: rewinding with silver-plated copper and cryo-treatment improved conductivity by 6%.

## Measurement stack

We run swept sine, THD, and noise profiling via our in-house rig. The chart below shows the THD delta compared to a control single coil.

### Media Examples

This section demonstrates how to embed different media types in blog posts:

**YouTube Video:**

**Note**: To add your own media files:
- Place video files in `/public/video/` directory
- Place audio files in `/public/audio/` directory
- Reference them like: `<BlogVideo src="/video/your-file.mp4" />` or `<audio controls src="/audio/your-file.mp3" />`

### User Feedback Survey

Below is a Formbricks survey component. To see it working:
1. Create a survey in your Formbricks account
2. Get the survey ID
3. Replace `surveyId="clwxyz123"` with your actual survey ID

<FormbricksSurvey surveyId="clwxyz123" mode="inline" />

**Note**: The survey shows "Loading survey..." because the `surveyId` is a placeholder. In production, you would use a real survey ID from your Formbricks dashboard.
